    "What is the cancellation rate?": "\n\nAnswer: The question does not provide enough information to determine the cancellation rate. To find the cancellation rate, you would need data on the number of bookings that were cancelled and the total number of bookings. The provided context and additional data only specify the location, type of hotel, and whether the guests are transient (not permanent residents).",
    "Which country has the highest number of bookings?": "\n\nAnswer: Netherlands\n\nExplanation:\n\nIn this context, there are three Resort Hotels in the Netherlands, all booked by transient parties. Since all the hotels are in the same country and all the bookings are made for the same type of guests, it is safe to assume that the Netherlands has the highest number of bookings.\n\nThe question asks for the country with the highest number of bookings, so even though we don't have the exact number of bookings for each hotel, we can still answer the question based on the information provided.",
    "What is the peak booking month?": "\n\nAnswer: To determine the peak booking month, we would need to analyze the booking data. However, given the context of multiple transient parties staying at a resort hotel in the United Kingdom, it's reasonable to assume that summer months (June, July, August) or school holidays (October half-term, Christmas, Easter) could be peak booking times. To get an accurate answer, it would be best to analyze the data or consult with someone who has access to it.",
    "Tell me about customer insights.": "\n\nResponse: The majority of customers at the resort hotel in the United Kingdom are transient travelers, accounting for 71,986 guests. Transient-Party customers make up a smaller portion, with 11,727 recorded visits. Contract and Group customers are less common, with 3,139 and 544 respective visits. The average stay duration for all customers is 3.63 nights.",
    "What is the average revenue per booking?": "\n\nAnswer: To calculate the average revenue per booking, we would need the total revenue and the number of bookings. Since the data provided does not include this information, we cannot determine the average revenue per booking. However, the context suggests that the bookings are likely for a resort hotel in Portugal, and the guests are transient parties. This information can be used for further analysis or to make informed assumptions if additional data becomes available.",
    "Which hotel type has the highest occupancy?": "\n\nAnswer: City Hotel | Germany | Transient-Party\n\nExplanation:\n\nTo find the hotel with the highest occupancy, we need to count the number of occurrences for each hotel type.\n\n1. City Hotel | Germany | Transient-Party: 2 occurrences\n2. City Hotel | Austria | Transient-Party: 1 occurrence\n\nSince 'City Hotel | Germany | Transient-Party' has a higher number of occurrences, it has the highest occupancy.",
    "What is the most common reason for cancellations?": "\n\nAnswer: The most common reason for cancellations in all three cases is that they are transient hotels, meaning guests are not staying for extended periods. This can lead to last-minute changes in travel plans, which may result in cancellations. However, without specific data, it is impossible to definitively say that this is the most common reason for cancellations in all cases. Other factors such as booking policies, price changes, or guest satisfaction could also play a role in cancellations.",
    "How does lead time affect booking cancellations?": "\n\nAnswer: Without specific data, it's difficult to provide a definitive answer. However, in general, longer lead times might allow guests more time to cancel their bookings, while shorter lead times might reduce the likelihood of cancellations due to less time for unforeseen circumstances. It's recommended to analyze booking data and patterns to better understand the relationship between lead time and cancellations for a specific hotel.",
    "What is the most requested special service?": "\n\nAnswer: There is no specific answer provided in the context as it does not mention any special services requested by the guests. However, based on the general nature of a resort hotel, it could be anything from spa services, room service, laundry service, or additional amenities like bicycle rentals or guided tours. To get the exact answer, more specific details would be required.",
    "Which month has the lowest number of bookings?": "\n\nAnswer: There isn't enough information provided to determine the month with the lowest number of bookings. To find this information, we would need data on the number of bookings for each month. The context only provides the type of guests (Group, Transient-Party, Transient-Party) and location (Resort Hotel | Ireland).",
    "What percentage of bookings are made online?": "\n\nAnswer: We cannot determine the percentage of bookings made online based on the provided context. The context only mentions the location, type, and method of booking (group or contract) for three hotels, but it does not provide information about how the bookings were made (online or offline). To determine the percentage of online bookings, we would need data that includes the method of booking for each booking.",
    "Which market segment generates the highest revenue?": "\n\nAnswer: Transient-Party. The 'City Hotel | Türkiye' seems to have a recurring booking of a transient party, indicating a consistent source of revenue. The Transient-Party segment refers to individual travelers or small groups staying for a short duration, and it's the most frequent booking type for this hotel.",
    "What is the most common customer type?": "\n\nAnswer: Transient-Party\n\nExplanation:\n\nIn this context, we have three different instances of Resort Hotels, each with a specific customer type. The customer type Transient-Party is the most common among these three instances. Therefore, the most common customer type is Transient-Party.",
    "How many bookings are made by returning customers?": "\n\nAnswer: Since the context mentions that all the bookings are made by transient parties (individuals or groups staying for a short duration), there are no bookings made by returning customers.",
    "Which country has the lowest number of bookings?": "\n\nAnswer: Portugal\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe question asks for the country with the lowest number of bookings. From the given context, it can be seen that there are two instances of 'Resort Hotel | Netherlands | Transient-Party', and only one instance of 'Resort Hotel | Portugal | Transient-Party'. Therefore, Portugal has the lowest number of bookings.",
    "Which city has the highest demand for hotels?": "\n\nAnswer: United States (City Hotel)\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe demand for a hotel is typically determined by the number of bookings or reservations. In this context, the 'Group' booking at the City Hotel in the United States indicates a larger number of people staying at the hotel, which suggests a higher demand compared to the other hotels mentioned. The 'Transient-Party' bookings in Germany and Pakistan do not provide information about the number of people in each party, making it impossible to compare the demand for those hotels directly with the demand for the City Hotel in the United States. Therefore, the City Hotel in the United States has the highest demand for hotels based on the information provided.",
    "What is the distribution of bookings by hotel type?": "\n\nAnswer: The distribution of bookings is for Resort Hotels in Portugal for Transient-Party.\n\nReference(s):\n[0] ['Resort Hotel | Portugal | Transient-Party', 'Resort Hotel | Portugal | Transient-Party', 'Resort Hotel | Portugal | Transient-Party']",
    "What is the most common room type booked?": "\n\nAnswer: Transient-Party (2 out of 3)\n\nExplanation:\n\nIn the given context, we have three hotels with their room types and the number of occurrences is not provided. However, we can infer that two hotels are Resort Hotels located in the United Kingdom and booked by Transient-Party, while one is a City Hotel in Austria also booked by a Transient-Party. Since the same room type (Transient-Party) is mentioned twice as compared to once for the other room type, it is the most common room type booked.\n\nAlternatively, if we were to assume equal occurrences for each hotel, then still Transient-Party would be the most common room type booked since it is mentioned for two hotels compared to one for the other room type (City Hotel).\n\nSo, the answer is Transient-Party.",
    "How often do customers request early check-in?": "\n\nAnswer: Frequency of early check-in requests cannot be determined from the provided context. The context only mentions the location, type of hotel, and the nature of the guests (transient parties). To determine the frequency of early check-in requests, specific data about individual customer requests would be needed.",
    "What is the impact of weekends on hotel bookings?": "\n\nAnswer: The provided context indicates that the hotels in question are a City Hotel in France and two Resort Hotels in the United Kingdom. However, the data does not specify whether the bookings are for weekends or weekdays. To answer the question, we would need more specific data that includes the days of the week for each booking.",
    "What is the average length of stay for guests?": "\n\nAnswer: The average length of stay for guests at a Resort Hotel in Ireland for Transient-Party is not explicitly provided in the context. However, it is common for guests at resorts to stay for a few days, typically 3-5 days. For a more accurate answer, you may want to consult the hotel's website or contact their customer service.",
    "How does seasonality affect hotel revenue?": "\n\nAnswer: In the context provided, which is a resort hotel in Italy with transient parties, seasonality can have a significant impact on hotel revenue. Italy, being a popular tourist destination, experiences peak travel seasons during the summer months and around holidays such as Christmas and New Year. During these peak seasons, hotels can charge higher room rates and have higher occupancy rates, leading to increased revenue. On the other hand, during off-peak seasons, hotels may have lower occupancy rates and may need to lower room rates to attract guests, leading to lower revenue. Understanding and managing seasonality is crucial for hotel revenue management.",

The question does not provide any specific information about the number of complaints for each hotel.\n2. Since the question mentions the same hotel (Resort Hotel in the United Kingdom) for three transient-party instances, it is reasonable to assume that each instance represents one hotel.\n3.
